what is the time and space complexity of the following code:-



    int a = 0, b = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        a += rand();
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)
    {
        b += rand();
    }
    The time complexity = O(n+m) and space complexity = O(1).
    
Explanation: The first loop is O(N) and the second loop is O(M). Since N and M are independent variables, so we canâ€™t say which one is the leading term. Therefore Time complexity of the given problem will be O(N+M).
Since variables size does not depend on the size of the input, therefore  Space Complexity will be constant or O(1)
